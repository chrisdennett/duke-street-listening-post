Audio switcher using the MakeyMakey and physical switchboard probably using a
lampshade.

TODO:

- Add a screen for the off setting - testcard maybe saying select track.
  - or could just be big text saying: "⬇ Select a Track ⬇ "
- Allowing positioning of LEDs and screen via keyboard - save to json.

IDEAS:

- Use two lamp shades so two different people can listen at the same time.
