Audio switcher using the MakeyMakey and physical switchboard probably using a
lampshade.

TODO:

- Add the LED style on/off lights to show what's playing.
- Set up a json file to use for sound, index, photos, title etc.
- Allowing positioning of LEDs and screen via keyboard - save to json.

IDEAS:

- Use two lamp shades so two different people can listen at the same time.
